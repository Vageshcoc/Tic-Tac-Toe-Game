TicTacToe Game in Java
This is a simple implementation of the classic TicTacToe game written in Java. The game allows the user to play against the computer. It checks for legal moves, displays the winner, and handles illegal moves gracefully by giving the user another chance to enter a valid move.

Features
User Input: Takes input from the user to make a move.
Computer Player: Implements a simple computer player using a random function to make moves.
Legal Move Validation: Checks if the user's move is legal before proceeding.
Exception Handling: Catches illegal move exceptions and prompts the user for another move.
Win Detection: Determines the winner between the user and the computer.
Getting Started
To run the game, ensure you have Java installed on your system.

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
Compile and run!

Usage
Upon starting the game, the TicTacToe grid is displayed.
Enter your move by specifying the row and column (e.g., "1 2").
If your move is legal, the game will proceed.
The computer will then make its move.
The game continues until a winner is determined or the board is filled (resulting in a draw).
